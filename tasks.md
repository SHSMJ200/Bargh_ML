ðŸŸ© To-Do
==========================


* Edit "seasonality.yaml" file. It's very bad structured!
* Edit "tables_columns.yaml" file. Why each name is repeated twice?
* Edit the method "fit" of the model Neural Network
*
* Run Neural Network
* Training one model for all plants or one for each plant??
* Add change point detection and choose the training data better
* LF1 is correct or LO????
* Why null data in temperature??

  ðŸŸ¨ Doing
  ==========================
* Predict all 24 hours simultaneously. A problem: We should interpolate non-peak generations
* 
* Package Prophet for time series
* 
*


  ðŸŸ¥ Done
  ==========================

* installing postgres
* connecting postgres to my project
* connect Database to Superset
* edit superset_guide file
* Understanding the code in Logger
* Cleaning the codes in crawler
* understanding and running the code in data
* Train a simple model on data
* Delete unnecessary files in the model folder
* Review/study the visualization files
* Divide into 3 separate module: 1. data selecting 2. feature selecting 3. train and fit the model
* Clean the codes in folders: models & visualization
* Connect to GitHub
* Edit function feature_over_time to plot more beautiful
* Choose the training data better. not just peak, but also M in summer and ...
* what is "require"?
* Add column color to plot better
* Check mse_computer
* Choose which features should be in the model training.
* Pay attention to affecting with delay. For example: temperature.
* how about generation with delay
